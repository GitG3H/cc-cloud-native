## Innova Cloud Application

### Technology Used -

#### React JS - Frontend

#### Firebase Authentication, Firestore database, Firebase hosting.

Motivation / Purpose:
This is a cross-platform cloud-native dynamic web application, deployed on Google Firebase and accessible via Play Store. Technologies include React JS, Firebase authentication, Firebase hosting, Firebase storage.
This application can be used by teams to collaborate and share information. It features the use of a chat engine, which synchronizes messages from multiple users in real time. Users can message using text, emojis, GIFs, etc. It acts as a shared workspace where discussions and digital content can be shared. The application also sends broadcast notifications to users, when the content needs to be shared across large groups of participants. The real time database is used as a web socket to transfer real time data effectively among users.
The technology stack includes – Firebase authentication, firebase storage, firebase hosting, React JS, Next JS. This application isolates the work among individuals by creating a room for their content and information. Application is developed in React JS, Next JS, firebase authentication and storage are built from Google’s firebase, and the complete application would be deployed using Firebase hosting. Data visualization is also achieved using firebase google analytics and fire store which is a real time database
